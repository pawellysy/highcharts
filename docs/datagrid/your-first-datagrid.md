Your first DataGrid
===

Follow these steps to create your first simple DataGrid:

### 1. Add a div
Add a `div` to your webpage with a specific id.

```html
<div id="container"></div>
```

### 2. Import (or install) the library
In this basic example we are going to create a simple Datagrid. First we have to import (or install) the Datagrid library.

```html
<script src="https://code.highcharts.com/dashboards/datagrid.js"></script>
```

You can find more information about installation in our [article](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/datagrid/installation).

### 3. Import CSS styles
The DataGrid requires a few basic styles, so you can get the basic one by
importing the modules to the CSS file as shown below.

```css
@import url("https://code.highcharts.com/dashboards/css/datagrid.css");
```

You can also use your own styles - check our [docs about styling](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/datagrid/style-by-css).

### 4. Configure the DataGrid
Inside the script tag, create a new instance of the DataGrid.  

To do so, you have to pass two arguments:  
* the divâ€™s id where the DataGrid should be initialized (see point 1).
* the object with DataGrid options.

For this you can use the factory function `DataGrid.dataGrid`:

```js
DataGrid.dataGrid('container', {...})
```

As options you have to provide the data that should be rendered:
```js
DataGrid.dataGrid('container', {
    dataTable: {
        columns: {
            product: ['Apples', 'Pears', 'Plums', 'Bananas'],
            weight: [100, 40, 0.5, 200],
            price: [1.5, 2.53, 5, 4.5]
        }
    }
});
```

### View the result
With the config above your DataGrid should look like the example below:
